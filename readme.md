# MICOLL ERC MAP
## This repository contains the source code for the [MICOLL ERC](https://micoll-erc.eu) (Grant agreement: 101002084) digital maps project.

### Project description üí°
The project aims at providing a web-based application that allows the users (typically historians and other experts) to access, search, and creates routes linked to historical evidences in a collaborative setting. Thereby, users can realize historical routes in terms of the waypoints being part of the pathway and, at the same time, consult the related historical information supporting it for a deeper understanding and comprehension.

### Try it üöÄ
You can consult the online instance of the project (link: [https://micoll-erc-maps.dei.unipd.it](https://micoll-erc-maps.dei.unipd.it) or try it on your machine by downloading and running it using Docker and, specifically, the `docker-compose` command.
 
 ### Reuse and adapt it ‚ö°Ô∏è
 The source code of the project is provided with MIT license so feel free to modify and adapt it as you prefer. You can take advantage of several off-the-shelf facilities and interfaces (e.g., searching and managing routes/waypoints data) shipped with the project so that you can reuse it in similar use cases that involve digital maps and evidence information that should be linked to geospatial data.
